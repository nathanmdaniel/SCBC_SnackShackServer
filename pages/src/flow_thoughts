pass workbook from:
server ->
index ->
app ->
register ->
	registerButtonContainer ->
	buttonLoader ->
	-> each of CategorizedButtons(split into worksheets there)

	transactionCard



in each CategprozedButton, need to store the position(sheet and row) it represents
- onClick() -> send position up to Register

in Register, send position down into Transaction Card

in Transaction Card, need to store the workbook(read-only) to display name/price

TransactionCard needs to use chips. They will store the position(sheet and row), name,
	price, and a function to send the position out to the transactionCard(for remove)

TransactionCard should keep track of items by keeping an array of chips. Remove function 
	should use splice to cut that item out of the array.

TransactionCard should keep track of active chip, default should be last chip in array
	(for remove function)
